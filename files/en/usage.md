Is time to code:

### Quick start

Here's a quick example to get you started, it's literally all you need:

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDom from "react-dom";
import MemeShare, { Container, AppleDots, Title } from "codememe2share";

const App () => {
  return (
    <MemeShare>
      <Container>
        <AppleDots />
          <Title variant="h3">
            Hola Mundo
          </Title>
       </Container>
    </MemeShare>
  );
}

ReactDom.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
